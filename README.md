# AnaLaTeX
`AnaLaTeX` consist of two parts, Ana + LaTeX:
1. Ana: is paronymous with an&#x0101; morpheme in ancient persian (Avestan) - also, these two morphemes are paronymous with greek one, ἀνά, to obtain more information about this morpheme you can refer to [Liddell-Scott Greek-English Lexicon](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a\)na/1) and [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BD%CE%AC).

2. LaTeX: is obvious, no need to waste of time. =)

Our purpose to call this collection `AnaLaTeX` is as follows:
1. This is a unique "Tips and Tricks" collection, and wants to be in depth of LaTeX engines, as explained in `Ana` definition, literally `AnaLaTeX` is a collection throughout LaTeX.

2. In phonological point of view, sounds like `analytic` which is just a linguistic game. =)
